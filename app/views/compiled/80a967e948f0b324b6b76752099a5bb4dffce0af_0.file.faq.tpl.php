			<p><strong><u>WHAT IS GAMEHEDGE?</u></strong></p>
			<p>GameHedge is a ticket marketplace. We accept orders for tickets from our customers and we then purchase those tickets on a secondary marketplace. Once we purchase the requested tickets, we will send a confirmation to the customer that they will receive their tickets.</p>
			<p><strong><u>ARE TICKETS PURCHASED ON GAMEHEDGE GUARANTEED?</u></strong></p>
			<p>Yes. Once an order is confirmed by GameHedge, we guarantee that the customer will receive authentic tickets for their event, prior to the event, or they will receive their money back. If we are unable to purchase the tickets which have been ordered by the customer, we will notify the customer that they will not receive their tickets. TICKETS ARE NOT DEEMED PURCHASED BY THE CUSTOMER UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES AN EMAIL CONFIRMING THE PURCHASE.</p>
			<p><strong><u>WHAT IS THE GOOD GAME GUARANTEE?</u></strong></p>
			<p>All tickets purchased on GameHedge come with the Good Game Guarantee, which means that if the home team loses by the number of runs or points as specified in Terms and Conditions, the customer will be entitled to a refund of 50% of the GameHedge ticket price. To be entitled to receive the refund, the customer must follow the rules set forth in the Terms and Conditions.</p>
			<p><strong><u>THE PRICE OF TICKETS</u></strong></p>
			<p>THE PRICE THAT YOU PAY FOR TICKETS ON GAMEHEDGE MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE FACE VALUE PRICE PRINTED ON THE TICKETS. GameHedge provides you with the service of locating tickets that may not be available through standard channels. Tickets listed on GameHedge are purchased and supplied by GameHedge, from pre-qualified, screened, professional ticket agencies as well as individual resellers of tickets. Those resellers list these tickets at prices determined by the reseller, which may be above the price printed on the face of the ticket. The market value price for a ticket is quite volatile, determined by many factors including seat location, supply and demand, date and location of event, etc.</p>
			<p><strong><u>HOW DO I CLAIM MY GOOD GAME GUARANTEE REFUND?</u></strong></p>
			<p>All claims for refunds ("Claims") must be made by the person who purchased the ticket from GameHedge and must be received by GameHedge within ninety (90) days from the date of the event. After the ninety-day period has expired, GameHedge will have no obligation to make the refund. The right to a refund may not be transferred or assigned by the purchaser of the ticket.</p>
			<p>The ticket holder must comply with the directions on GameHedge.com for making a Claim. GameHedge has no responsibility to notify ticket holder that they may be entitled to a refund for any particular event. The Good Game Guarantee refund will be made by GameHedge within thirty (30) days of receipt of the valid Claim from the purchaser.</p>
			<p><strong><u>WHAT IS THE ORDER CONFIRMATION PROCESS?</u></strong></p>
			<p>After you submit your request for tickets, you will receive an email notifying you that we have received your request. This does not confirm ticket availability or prices. It only indicates that we have received your request for those tickets and have begun the process for securing the requested tickets. Once the requested tickets have been secured by us, your credit card will be charged and you should receive an Order Confirmation or link to print your tickets confirming that your request has been finalized and we have purchased the tickets on your behalf. You should also receive a copy of your invoice. In some instances, when the physical tickets or bar code electronic ticket are not yet available, the delivery update acts as your confirmation until the ticket is delivered. Your order may be finalized even if you do not receive an Order Confirmation, finalized invoice or an updated status email from us. If you have not heard from us, or have only received a confirmation that we received your ticket request, please call our office to check on your order.</p>
			<p><strong><u>HOW DO I RECEIVE MY TICKETS?</u></strong></p>
			<p>If your tickets are being delivered via E-Mail, you will receive a link containing the actual tickets for the event. We monitor all outbound e-mails to ensure they are received by you.</p>
			<p>Choosing to have tickets shipped does not ensure that the ticket will be a hard ticket. All tickets shipped will be done so via an express delivery service (i.e., Federal Express, Express Mail, messenger, etc.) and will require an adult signature. We use express delivery services requiring signature to ensure that your tickets arrive safely and that they can be tracked at any time. It is your responsibility to track your package and to be available to accept the package. You agree to provide us with a secure delivery location and authorize someone at that address to act as your agent in your absence to accept delivery of the package. If you provide a delivery location other than your credit card billing location, you hereby specifically agree to be responsible for that delivery and the tickets once delivered to the address you specify. You agree not to dispute such charges. Your expected ticket arrival date is based on the actual date we ship the order.</p>
			<p>As example; if you choose "One Day Shipping" you will get your tickets one business day after the seller ships the tickets and not necessarily one business day after you place your order.</p>
			<p>If for any reason your tickets are returned to us, we will try to contact you to arrange for another delivery attempt. If you are unavailable or if you refuse delivery of your tickets, the tickets may be listed for sale on consignment with GameHedge at a price and on terms determined by GameHedge.</p>
			<p><strong><u>WHAT HAPPENS IF I LOSE MY TICKETS?</u></strong></p>
			<p>When you receive your tickets keep them in a safe place. Unfortunately, GameHedge cannot guarantee that tickets can be replaced if they are lost, stolen, or damaged.</p>
			<p><strong><u>WHAT IF AN EVENT IS CANCELLED?</u></strong></p>
			<p>If an event is cancelled for any reason other than an act of God (rainout, earthquake, flood, etc.), war, terrorism, strike, or lockout, we will provide a full refund for the amount that you paid for the tickets. Shipping charges are not refundable. TICKETS MUST BE RECEIVED BACK IN OUR OFFICE WITHIN 14 DAYS OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE EVENT CANCELLATION. In case of a rainout or strike for a sporting event, no refunds will be made.</p>
			<p><strong><u>WHAT IF AN EVENT IS POSTPONED OR RESCHEDULED?</u></strong></p>
			<p>If an event is postponed or rescheduled, the tickets will be honored for the rescheduled event date. New tickets will not need to be issued for most rescheduled events or postponements. Since we are unable to recover our costs on the tickets that we acquired for you, we in turn are unable to offer customers refunds on postponed or rescheduled events.</p>
